## What is Undercooked?

Undercooked is a video game I made as part of my first project during my coding bootcamp at IronHack.

## What's the goal?

**Who are you?** You're a chef!

**Your goal**: make the customers happy!

**How**? Prepare the dishes and send them in time!

## How do you play it?

Easy. Use your keyboard's arrow keys and space bar (sorry mobile users).
